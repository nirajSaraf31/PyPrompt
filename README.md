# PyPrompt

**PyPrompt** is a lightweight shell interface built in Python. It mimics basic features of a Unix shell such as command execution, directory navigation, and output/error redirection. Designed as a learning tool, PyPrompt gives insight into how a simple shell works internally.

## 📌 Features

- 🧭 Built-in commands: `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, `type`, `exit`
- ⚙️ Executes binaries found in the system `$PATH`
- 🪵 Supports output (`>`, `>>`) and error (`2>`, `2>>`) redirection
- 🚫 Handles invalid commands gracefully
- 🔁 Simple and persistent command loop

## 🔧 Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x

### Run the Shell

```bash
python3 pyprompt.py
```
